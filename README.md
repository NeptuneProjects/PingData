# PingData

`PingData` is a lightweight Python package for reading HumminBird metadata/sonar files and writing them to user-friendly formats.
The package is a fork of Cameron Bodine's `PINGMapper` project, which provides far more comprehensive (and complex) workflows than this package.
This package is completely unopinionated, and provides only raw metadata and sonar data (in integer format) with no post-processing.
